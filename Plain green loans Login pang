Payday loan is an unsecured loan given with a short period of maturity and high interest rate. Such loan is somewhat the same with credit card cash advance, only a borrower usually provides lenders with post dated checks or a debit authorization on their paycheck as payment for the amount of loan plus interest.

Before making such loan, the borrower must see to it that he or she can repay the principal and the interest on his or her next payroll. The borrower must also understand what possible consequences are if he or she cannot pay the loan back on time.

Risks and Warnings when Applying for a Payday Loan:

1. This type of loan cannot be used as a primary source of emergency money because of its high interest rates and additional fees. Also, there is great risk of not being able to pay the whole amount on time since the interest is so high and almost unaffordable.

2. Before borrowing money from payday loan, make sure you have tried every possible alternative on getting instant cash. Payday loan must only be treated as a last solution to a problem.
